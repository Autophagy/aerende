Creating, Editing and Deleting Notes
====================================

Notes can be created via ``n``. The note editor prompt will open at the bottom,
requiring a note title, a ``//`` seperated list of note tags, and then the default
editor will open for the note's content.

Editing a note is done via ``e``. This will open the same note editor prompt, but
with the note's current values autofilled.

The note editing prompt can be cancelled with esc.

Deleting a note is done via ``d``.

A note's priority can be increased with ``+`` and decreased with ``-``. This
priority affects the sorting of notes, and notes with a priority of >= 10 are
considered high priority.
