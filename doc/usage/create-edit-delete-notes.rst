Creating, Editing and Deleting Notes
====================================

Notes can be created by the ``n`` shortcut. This will prompt you for a note
title, a comma seperated list of categories (entering nothing will assign it a
``none`` category), and then an editor will open for the note.

Notes can be edited by using the ``e`` shortcut. You will then be asked for the
title, categories and text of the note.

Notes can be deleted by using the ``d`` shortcut. A note can be cloned using the
``c`` shortcut. Notes can have their priority decremented/incremented via 
``shift+k`` and ``shift+j`` respectively.
