Ærende is a tool to facilitate the recording of reminders, similar to post-it
notes. It is tool 02 (probably) of andgelóman. It uses a curses-style TUI, via
[urwid](http://urwid.org/).

Notes are currently stored in a flat yml file in `~/.andgeloman/aerende/data.yml`,
though this data path can be configured in `config.yml`.
